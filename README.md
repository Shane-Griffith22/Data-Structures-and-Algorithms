# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course, my main objective was to learn about and implement different data structures so that I could accurately and efficiently sort through different file systems. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached this problem by breaking each one down into smaller problems and solving them seperately. I find that trying to get the final solution before solving the ones necessary to get there makes the project overall much more difficult and that breaking them down and working on them seperately makes the project more attainable overall. 

Datastructures are important because they let us manage large data sets much easier. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Using tools like cplusplus.com and cppreference.com have been benefitted me greatly when trying to learn to do something I have never done before, or trying to clear the fog overall to become a better programmer. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Before this course, I had only ever user arrays and vectors as data sturctures. Learning about binary trees, linked lists, and hastables have just help add more tools to my toolkit to help me professionally when the time comes. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project specifically helped me really nail down a process that works for me when working on projects. Before this project, during the other projects that I worked on in the past for school, I was really more tyring to understand the fundamentals of programming. Now that I feel like I have a good understanding of the fundamentals, I was able to really nail down the process and work on finding resources I would be able to use in the future.
